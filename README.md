# Vector AI

## Overview
Vector AI is building the first end-to-end AI certification platform that automates safety-critical system verification from requirements to flight-ready. By combining Machine Learning for fault detection with Large Language Models for requirements intelligence, we're transforming how aerospace and defense systems achieve certification.

## 🎯 The Complete Platform Vision
Our platform integrates three powerful pillars to create a seamless certification workflow:

### Pillar 1: ML Fault Detection
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify subtle issues in flight test data
- **Pattern Recognition:** Discover correlations across datasets
- **Automated Clustering:** Group related faults for efficient analysis
- **Root Cause Analysis:** AI-powered investigation of system behaviors

### Pillar 2: LLM Requirements Intelligence
- **Document Processing:** Auto-parse requirements documents
- **Traceability Mapping:** Generate comprehensive matrices
- **Compliance Analysis:** Map requirements → tests → code → results
- **Gap Detection:** Flag compliance issues before audits

### Pillar 3: AI Certification Automation
- **Documentation Generation:** Auto-create DO-178C/DO-330 artifacts
- **Compliance Reporting:** Produce audit-ready documentation
- **Coverage Validation:** Verify test coverage against requirements
- **Artifact Generation:** Auto-generate certification deliverables

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Safety-critical system certification (DO-178C, DO-330, etc.) is a manually intensive, time-consuming, and high-risk process.
- Teams struggle to efficiently analyze vast amounts of test data and ensure complete traceability from requirements to test results.
- Manual documentation and audit preparation lead to significant delays and cost overruns.

## 💡 Solution
Vector AI provides a comprehensive platform that:
1. **Automates Fault Detection:** ML models identify anomalies and patterns in test data
2. **Intelligently Processes Requirements:** LLMs parse and analyze certification requirements
3. **Streamlines Certification:** AI generates compliant documentation and artifacts

## 🛠️ Features
- **Intelligent Data Processing:** Upload and analyze test data in various formats
- **ML-Powered Analysis:** Detect anomalies and cluster related issues
- **LLM Requirements Processing:** Parse and analyze certification requirements
- **Automated Traceability:** Map requirements to test data and results
- **Certification Support:** Generate DO-178C/DO-330 compliant artifacts
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize analysis results and compliance status

## 🎯 Target Users
- Aerospace OEMs
- Defense Integrators
- Space Systems Providers
- UAS Manufacturers
- Teams in Simulation & Validation, Test & Certification, Systems Integration, and Safety & Reliability

## 🔒 Competitive Advantage
- **End-to-End Automation:** Complete certification workflow automation
- **Integrated Intelligence:** ML + LLM for comprehensive analysis
- **Accelerated Certification:** Reduce time-to-certification by 60%
- **Domain Expertise:** Built by aerospace certification experts
