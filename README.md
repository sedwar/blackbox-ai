# BlackBox AI

The Intelligence Layer for Mission-Critical Aerospace Systems

## Overview

BlackBox AI is not just another AI tool â€” it's a specialized intelligence layer for aerospace fault detection, built by someone who's lived the problem. We transform archaic sensor fusion and fault detection processes into a modern, ML-powered system that defense primes and aerospace companies can trust.

## The Real Problem

### Current State
- Manual, brittle testing processes that can't scale
- Shallow or nonexistent ML support in existing tools
- Massive regulatory inertia preventing modernization
- Disconnected systems requiring expert intervention
- Costly, time-consuming certification cycles

### Why It's Hard to Fix
- Decades of layered system behavior to understand
- Complex regulatory requirements (DO-178C, DO-330)
- Need for deep domain expertise in avionics
- Critical nature of the systems (safety-critical)
- Integration challenges with legacy systems

## Our Solution

### Core Technology
- Specialized ML models for avionics fault detection
- Real-time sensor fusion and anomaly detection
- Automated parsing of A429, MIL-STD-1553, GPS, IRS data
- Explainable AI for regulatory compliance
- Seamless integration with existing V&V pipelines

### Why We're Different
- Built by an insider who understands the problem deeply
- Focused exclusively on aerospace fault detection
- Designed for regulatory compliance from day one
- Explains its decisions for trust and certification
- Moves 100x faster than internal development
