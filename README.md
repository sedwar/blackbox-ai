# BlackBox AI

An AI-powered fault detection and reporting platform for aerospace and defense systems. BlackBox AI ingests raw avionics logs — from sensors, buses, and mission systems — and automatically detects faults, anomalies, and critical failure patterns using machine learning. It then generates structured, auditable reports for use in system verification, testing, and certification workflows.

## Problem Statement

Aircraft (both commercial and military) generate enormous volumes of sensor and bus-level data (e.g., A429, MIL-STD-1553, GPS, IRS). Fault identification is still heavily manual, requiring expert review of logs, raw bits, and custom scripts. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers need faster, more scalable ways to detect, classify, and report faults — especially in safety-critical, test-heavy programs.

## Solution

BlackBox AI is an ML-based platform that:
- Parses and normalizes raw avionics logs (e.g., A429, GPS, INS, bus-level data)
- Applies custom-trained models to detect faults and anomalies (e.g., sensor disagreement, dropouts, stuck values, data spikes)
- Outputs a structured, auditable fault report with classification, timestamps, probable cause, and severity
- Integrates with existing V&V (Verification & Validation) pipelines or DevOps environments

## Features (MVP)

- **Log Upload Portal**: Upload avionics logs in CSV, JSON, or binary formats
- **Real-Time Analysis Engine**: ML-driven parser to flag fault patterns
- **Interactive Dashboard**: View and verify each fault with metadata (timestamp, sensor, type)
- **Exportable Reports**: Auto-generate fault summary PDFs and JSON reports
- **Custom Fault Libraries**: Define domain-specific detection rules alongside ML

## Target Users

- Mission Systems Engineers
- Flight Test Teams
- Aerospace Software V&V Engineers
- Defense System Integrators
- Avionics OEMs & Tier 1 Suppliers

## Competitive Advantage

- Leverages domain-specific ML models with tunable parameters per aircraft/system
- Enables consistent, scalable fault reporting across programs and teams
- Reduces test/verification cycle time for certifiable software
- Can serve both internal OEM tooling and customer-facing deliverables

## MVP Build Plan (30-Day Timeline)

1. Week 1: Lock down 3 initial fault types + log data format
2. Week 2: Build log parser + ML-based fault detector
3. Week 3: Build web-based upload + dashboard prototype
4. Week 4: Generate sample reports + prepare investor deck

## Funding Plan

Initial target:
- Design Partners: 2–3 early aerospace/defense groups willing to test
- Pre-Seed Raise: $500K–$1.5M (tools + headcount for FAA/EASA cert, UI, and sales)
