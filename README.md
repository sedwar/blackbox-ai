# BlackBox AI

## Overview
BlackBox AI is an AI-powered fault detection and reporting platform for aerospace and defense systems. It transforms complex avionics test data into clear, actionable insights using machine learning, eliminating the need for manual log analysis and custom scripts.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Aircraft (both commercial and military) generate enormous volumes of sensor and bus-level data (e.g., A429, MIL-STD-1553, GPS, IRS)
- Fault identification is still heavily manual, requiring expert review of logs, raw bits, and custom scripts
- OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers need faster, more scalable ways to detect, classify, and report faults — especially in safety-critical, test-heavy programs

## 💡 Solution
BlackBox AI provides:
- Intelligent parsing and normalization of raw avionics logs
- ML-based fault detection and anomaly identification
- Automated generation of certification-ready documentation
- Seamless integration with existing V&V pipelines

## 🛠️ Features
- **Log Processing**: Upload and process avionics logs in CSV, JSON, or binary formats
- **Fault Detection**: ML-driven analysis to identify fault patterns and anomalies
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of fault detection results
- **Certification Reports**: Auto-generate DO-178C compliant documentation
- **Custom Rules**: Define domain-specific detection rules alongside ML models

## 🎯 Target Users
- Mission Systems Engineers
- Flight Test Teams
- Aerospace Software V&V Engineers
- Defense System Integrators
- Avionics OEMs & Tier 1 Suppliers

## 🔒 Competitive Advantage
- Domain-specific ML models with tunable parameters
- Consistent, scalable fault reporting across programs
- Reduced test/verification cycle time
- DO-178C certification ready from day one
