# BlackBox AI

Advanced AI-Powered Avionics Fault Detection Platform

## Overview

BlackBox AI is an AI-powered fault detection and reporting platform for aerospace and defense systems. It ingests raw avionics logs — from sensors, buses, and mission systems — and automatically detects faults, anomalies, and critical failure patterns using machine learning. The platform generates structured, auditable reports for use in system verification, testing, and certification workflows.

## Problem Statement

Aircraft (both commercial and military) generate enormous volumes of sensor and bus-level data (e.g., A429, MIL-STD-1553, GPS, IRS). Current fault identification is heavily manual, requiring expert review of logs, raw bits, and custom scripts. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers need faster, more scalable ways to detect, classify, and report faults — especially in safety-critical, test-heavy programs.

## Solution

BlackBox AI provides:
- Advanced ML-based fault detection for avionics systems
- Automated parsing and normalization of raw avionics logs
- Real-time anomaly detection and pattern recognition
- DO-178C compliant reporting and documentation
- Seamless integration with existing V&V pipelines
