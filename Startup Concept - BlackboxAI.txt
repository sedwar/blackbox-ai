🚀 Startup Concept Brief: BlackBox AI
🧭 Overview
BlackBox AI is an AI-powered fault detection and reporting platform for aerospace and defense systems. It ingests raw avionics logs — from sensors, buses, and mission systems — and automatically detects faults, anomalies, and critical failure patterns using machine learning. It then generates structured, auditable reports for use in system verification, testing, and certification workflows.

🎯 Problem Statement
Aircraft (both commercial and military) generate enormous volumes of sensor and bus-level data (e.g., A429, MIL-STD-1553, GPS, IRS).

Fault identification is still heavily manual, requiring expert review of logs, raw bits, and custom scripts.

OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers need faster, more scalable ways to detect, classify, and report faults — especially in safety-critical, test-heavy programs.

💡 Solution: BlackBox AI
An ML-based platform that:

Parses and normalizes raw avionics logs (e.g., A429, GPS, INS, bus-level data)

Applies custom-trained models to detect faults and anomalies (e.g., sensor disagreement, dropouts, stuck values, data spikes)

Outputs a structured, auditable fault report with classification, timestamps, probable cause, and severity

Integrates with existing V&V (Verification & Validation) pipelines or DevOps environments

🛠️ Features (MVP)
Log Upload Portal: Upload avionics logs in CSV, JSON, or binary formats

Real-Time Analysis Engine: ML-driven parser to flag fault patterns

Interactive Dashboard: View and verify each fault with metadata (timestamp, sensor, type)

Exportable Reports: Auto-generate fault summary PDFs and JSON reports

Custom Fault Libraries: Define domain-specific detection rules alongside ML

📈 Target Users
Mission Systems Engineers

Flight Test Teams

Aerospace Software V&V Engineers

Defense System Integrators

Avionics OEMs & Tier 1 Suppliers

🔒 Competitive Advantage
Leverages domain-specific ML models with tunable parameters per aircraft/system

Enables consistent, scalable fault reporting across programs and teams

Reduces test/verification cycle time for certifiable software

Can serve both internal OEM tooling and customer-facing deliverables

🧠 Founder Fit
Founder: Software Engineer III, Boeing — with 7+ years of end-to-end development on the 737 Mission Systems

Hands-on experience with fault detection, A429 decoding, sensor validation, and full software V&V lifecycle

Background in machine learning applied to real-world signal data (including predictive modeling for sports and betting)

🔧 MVP Build Plan (30-Day Timeline)
Week	Milestone
1	Lock down 3 initial fault types + log data format
2	Build log parser + ML-based fault detector
3	Build web-based upload + dashboard prototype
4	Generate sample reports + prepare investor deck

💰 Funding Plan
Initial target:

Design Partners: 2–3 early aerospace/defense groups willing to test

Pre-Seed Raise: $500K–$1.5M (tools + headcount for FAA/EASA cert, UI, and sales)

🚀 Next Steps
You (the founder) are:

Gathering log formats + selecting fault types

Prototyping core detection logic

Preparing a cold outreach list of aerospace teams (test, MSA, certification) for validation
